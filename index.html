      <h1>Responsive Web Design; The Solution To The Modern Day Web</h1>
    </header>

    <p>The biggest issue that responsive web design solves all has to do with the multitude of devices we own today that have access to the internet. All of these devices have different screen sizes and resolutions, this in turn causes major headaches for any modern day web developers or designers.
    </p>

    <p>The main objective of any website is to provide services and or information to a user, either for free or for monetary gains. If said user views a web page on their mobile device, (most likely these days) there's a good chance that the user will encounter a frustrating experience while navigating your web page. Implementing responsive web design in to your web page would allow the user to view your content on virtually any device with any screen resolution without any major detriment to the content either being visible or accessible.
    </p>

    <p>In the past there would be reason to design a separate mobile site and a separate desktop site. Today you would just use responsive web design. This eliminates the need for multiple versions of a single site that need maintenance. To do this the developer or designer (as a bare minumum) should use use flexible grid systems and images in their layouts. This allows the content of the site to adjust to its medium without hiding content under other content or shooting it off in to space nowhwere to be seen.
